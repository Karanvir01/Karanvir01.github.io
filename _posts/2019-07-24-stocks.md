  This project utilized multiple machine learning algorithims including:
  1. Neural network
  2. Naive bayes
  3. Linear Regression

  The stock market is a very volatile agent that can cost many people a lot of money. Whenever investing in it, one has to take into consideration many techinical indicators such as RSI and other shit.

  The research paper that explains everything in much more detail is linked down below [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CH2NBqQ97SmrK-o2fUZSxCD8w3tXd9uhHxf5t3MG4to/edit?usp=sharing)
