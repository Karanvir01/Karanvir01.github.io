Over the course of the last two years, I have done several Computer Science projects. In this page, I will highlight the most significant projects I have done thus far.

## Predicting stock price trends using Machine Learning Algorithm
The most significant project I have conducted is a Machine Learning project that utilizes Neural Networks, Naive Bayes, and Linear Regression to predict stock price trends. The coding languages used in this project include: Python, R, and RStudio.

## Using the MiniMax Algorithm to create a unbeatable TicTacToe AI

Artificial Intelligence has interested me since I was a kid. From taking inspiration from Tesla's autopilot and from the iPhone's SIRI, I decided to make a TicTacToe game that would use Artificial Intelligence to become unbeatable. This project was coded in Java.

# My Experience

Along with the many difficult projects that I have conducted, I have also gained much needed experience in the Computer Science field.

## DataBase Administrator Intern

In this internship, I assisted a Database Administrator. I would help handle capacity planning, evaluate database server hardware, and manage all aspects of an Oracle database including installation, configuration, design, and data migration.

## NASA Academy Intern

I was given the opportunity to intern at the Virginia Space Coast NASA program. This unique opportunity allowed me to express my leadership skills and create a framework mission to Mars alongside many NASA engineers. I was elected to be the project leader for my group, which meant I was in charge of making sure everything was running smooth and up-to date.

## Computer Science Teacher Assistant

In my high school, I was the Computer Science Teacher Assistant. I would help the teacher create lesson plans, assist in making the website that we used, manage a sector of the students, and make sure that all the students understood the lessons that the teacher was teaching.
