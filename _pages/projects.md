Over the course of the last two years, I have done several Computer Science projects. In this page, I will highlight the most significant projects I have done thus far.

## Predicting stock price trends using Machine Learning Algorithm
The most significant project I have conducted is a Machine Learning project that utilizes Neural Networks, Naive Bayes, and Linear Regression to predict stock price trends. The coding languages used in this project include: Python, R, and RStudio.

## Using the MiniMax Algorithm to create a unbeatable TicTacToe AI

Artificial Intelligence has interested me since I was a kid. From taking inspiration from Tesla's autopilot and from the iPhone's SIRI, I decided to make a TicTacToe game that would use Artificial Intelligence to become unbeatable. This project was coded in Java.

# My Experience

Along with the many difficult projects that I have conducted, I have also gained much needed experience in the Computer Science field.
