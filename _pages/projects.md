Over the course of the last two years, I have done several Computer Science projects. In this page, I will highlight the most significant projects I have done thus far.

## Predicting stock price trends using Machine Learning Algorithm
The most significant project I have conducted is a Machine Learning project that utilizes Neural Networks, Naive Bayes, and Linear Regression to predict stock price trends.
